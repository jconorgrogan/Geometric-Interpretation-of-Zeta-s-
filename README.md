# Geometric-Interpretation-of-Zeta-s-

Stumbled upon 3 new constants I don't think Ive seen mentioned before, as well as a simple geometric interpretation of zeta(odd) and zeta(even).

# Circle–Polygon Geometry and Infinite Sums

## 1. Two Infinite Sums and Their Difference

We analyze two sums comparing a unit circle and inscribed regular polygons:

- **Even Sum (S_even):** Total discrepancy between the circle’s circumference \(2\pi\) and the perimeter of an \(n\)-gon \(2n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\), summed over \(n = 1\) to \(\infty\).  
  **Numerical value:** ~12.5491.

- **Odd Sum (S_odd):** Single chord–arc difference \(\left( \frac{2\pi}{n} - 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \right)\), summed over \(n = 1\) to \(\infty\).  
  **Numerical value:** ~8.1929.

Their difference:

\[
\Delta = S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} \approx 4.35623879.
\]

## 2. The Surprising Appearance of All Integer Zeta Values

Expanding the summands into power series for large \(n\), we find terms in \(\frac{1}{n^2}, \frac{1}{n^3}, \frac{1}{n^4}, \dots\), which involve Riemann zeta values \(\zeta(2), \zeta(3), \zeta(4), \dots\):

- **S_even:** Expands in even powers (\(\zeta(2), \zeta(4), \zeta(6), \dots\)).
- **S_odd:** Expands in odd powers (\(\zeta(3), \zeta(5), \zeta(7), \dots\)).

The difference combines all integer zeta values \(\zeta(k)\) (\(k \geq 2\)):

\[
S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} = \alpha_2 \zeta(2) + \alpha_3 \zeta(3) + \alpha_4 \zeta(4) + \alpha_5 \zeta(5) + \dots \approx 4.35623879,
\]

where the coefficients \(\alpha_k\) are rational multiples of \(\pi^{2k+1}\). First few values:

- \(\alpha_2 = +\frac{\pi^3}{3}\),
- \(\alpha_3 = -\frac{\pi^3}{3}\),
- \(\alpha_4 = -\frac{\pi^5}{60}\),
- \(\alpha_5 = +\frac{\pi^5}{60}\),
- …

## 3. Leading Terms in Each Expansion

- **For \(\zeta(2):\**  
  The perimeter shortfall begins with a term proportional to \(\frac{1}{n^2}\), summing to \(\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\).

- **For \(\zeta(3):\**  
  The chord–arc difference starts with \(\frac{1}{n^3}\), summing to \(\zeta(3)\). Its coefficient \(\frac{\pi^3}{3}\) appears naturally in the small-angle expansion of \(\sin x\).

A pairing pattern emerges:

\[
( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} )\zeta(2), \, ( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} )\zeta(3), \, ( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} )\zeta(4), \, ( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} )\zeta(5), \dots
\]

with alternating signs for consecutive \(\zeta(k)\).

## 4. Numerical Value and No Known Closed Form

- **Numerical Value:**  
  \(\Delta \approx 4.35623879\).

- **No Known Closed Form:**  
  \(\Delta\) is not expressible in terms of \(\pi\) or elementary constants. It represents a new constant arising from a sum of scaled Riemann zeta values.

---

## 5. Conceptual Interpretation

- **Circle–Polygon Geometry:**  
  \(S_\text{even}\) and \(S_\text{odd}\) reflect two ways of approximating the circle:
  - Full \(n\)-gon perimeter shortfall.
  - Single chord–arc difference for one side.

- **Even vs. Odd Zeta:**  
  Multiplying \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\) by \(n\) shifts powers of \(\frac{1}{n}\) from \(\frac{1}{n^3} \to \frac{1}{n^2}\), toggling from odd to even exponents.

- **A Unified Sum:**  
  The difference merges both expansions, capturing \(\zeta(2), \zeta(3), \zeta(4), \dots\) in one infinite series.

\[
S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} \approx 4.3562
\]

This embodies all integer zeta values \(\zeta(k)\) (\(k \geq 2\)) in an elegant circle–polygon framework.
