# Geometric Interpretation of ζ(s): A Recursive Curvature View

Stumbled upon an interesting constant I don’t think has been discussed before in the literature.

## 1. Two Infinite Sums from Circle Approximations

We define two infinite sums that quantify how polygon approximations deviate from the unit circle:

- **S_even:**  
  Sum of the differences between the circle's circumference \(2\pi\) and the perimeter of regular n-gons inscribed in the circle:  
  \[
  S_{\text{even}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( 2\pi - 2n \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \right) \approx 12.5491
  \]

- **S_odd:**  
  Sum of the chord–arc difference on each polygon side, calculated side-by-side:  
  \[
  S_{\text{odd}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{2\pi}{n} - 2\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \right) \approx 8.1929
  \]

**Difference between them:**
\[
\Delta = S_{\text{even}} - S_{\text{odd}} \approx 4.35623879
\]

This difference turns out to encode a unified, infinite expansion over ζ(k ≥ 2).

## 2. Appearance of All Integer Zeta Values

Expanding both \(S_{\text{even}}\) and \(S_{\text{odd}}\) as asymptotic series in \(1/n\), we find:

- **S_even** contains terms involving even-indexed zeta values: \( \zeta(2), \zeta(4), \zeta(6), \ldots \)  
- **S_odd** contains terms involving odd-indexed zeta values: \( \zeta(3), \zeta(5), \zeta(7), \ldots \)  

The difference \(\Delta\) can be written as a convergent series:
\[
\Delta = \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \alpha_k \cdot \zeta(k)
\]
with π-weighted coefficients:

- \( \alpha_2 = +\frac{\pi^3}{3} \)  
- \( \alpha_3 = -\frac{\pi^3}{3} \)  
- \( \alpha_4 = -\frac{\pi^5}{60} \)  
- \( \alpha_5 = +\frac{\pi^5}{60} \)  
- \( \alpha_6 = +\frac{\pi^7}{2520} \)  
- \( \alpha_7 = -\frac{\pi^7}{2520} \)  
- …  

These coefficients alternate in sign and scale with odd powers of π, normalized by factorial-like symmetry terms.

## 3. Leading Term Interpretation

- **ζ(2):**  
  Perimeter shortfall scales with \(1/n^2\), summing to \(\zeta(2) = \pi^2/6\).  

- **ζ(3):**  
  Arc–chord difference scales with \(1/n^3\), summing to \(\zeta(3)\). The leading coefficient \(\pi^3/3\) comes from expanding \(\sin(x)\) at small angles.  

A pairing structure emerges:
\[
\left( \pm \tfrac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(2),\quad
\left( \pm \tfrac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(3),\quad
\left( \pm \tfrac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(4),\quad
\left( \pm \tfrac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(5),\ldots
\]

## 3a. Memory Systems of Error

These two expansions can be seen as *two irreducible ways a structure can hold errors in memory*:

1. **Local memory (odd zetas):**  
   Each arc–chord error is stored independently, side by side, without scaling.  

2. **Global memory (even zetas):**  
   Each error is stored only after being scaled by the polygon’s size (the number of sides), compressing local details into a whole-shape record.  

The difference
\[
\Delta = S_{\text{even}} - S_{\text{odd}}
\]
is then the **error between memory systems themselves** — the residue created when you compare these two storage strategies.

---

## 4. A New Mathematical Constant

- **Numerical Value:**  
  \[
  \Delta \approx 4.35623879
  \]

- **No Known Closed Form:**  
  This constant has no known expression in terms of π, e, or known zeta values alone. It appears to be a transcendental object generated from the infinite recursive projection residue.

---

## 5. Conceptual Interpretation

- **Dual memory systems:**  
  \(S_{\text{odd}}\) = local memory of errors (odd zetas).  
  \(S_{\text{even}}\) = global memory of errors (even zetas).  

- **Residue between systems:**  
  The mismatch (\(\Delta\)) does not measure error in the circle itself, but the *gap between two ways of storing the same error data*.  

- **Zeta integration:**  
  The whole ζ-ladder arises because both systems are derived from the same kernel. Odd and even zetas reflect the two fundamental strategies for encoding structure.

---

## 6. Dimensionless Ratio of Approximations

Define:
\[
R = \frac{S_{\text{odd}}}{S_{\text{even}}} = \frac{8.1929}{12.5491} \approx 0.65286468
\]

Interpretation:  
- About **65.3%** of errors are visible if you use **local memory** (odd zetas).  
- The other **34.7%** only appear under **global memory** (even zetas).  
- In IC terms: this ratio quantifies the split between fragmental vs holistic encoding. The missing fraction is indistinction that only resolves globally.  

---

## 7. Summary

The geometric difference between approximating a circle with:  
- **Full polygons (S_even)** vs.  
- **Side-by-side arc–chord segments (S_odd)**  

produces a finite, convergent quantity:
\[
\Delta = \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \alpha_k \cdot \zeta(k) \approx 4.35623879
\]

This value:  
- Encodes **all integer ζ(k ≥ 2)** values  
- Emerges from **pure geometry**  
- Represents a **total recursive projection curvature residue**  
- Captures the **residue between two memory systems of error**
