# Geometric Interpretation of Zeta(s)

Stumbled upon an interesting geometric interpretation of zeta(s) I haven't seen before, including a dimensionless (transendental?) ratio

## 1. Two Infinite Sums and Their Difference

We analyze two infinite sums involving a unit circle and its inscribed regular polygons:

- **Even Sum (S_even):** Sum of the discrepancies between the circle’s circumference \(2\pi\) and the perimeters of inscribed regular \(n\)-gons \(2n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\), for \(n = 1\) to \(\infty\).  
  **Numerical value:** approximately 12.5491.

- **Odd Sum (S_odd):** Sum of single chord–arc differences \(\left( \frac{2\pi}{n} - 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \right)\), for \(n = 1\) to \(\infty\).  
  **Numerical value:** approximately 8.1929.

Their difference is defined as:

\[
\Delta = S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} \approx 4.35623879.
\]

## 2. The Surprising Appearance of All Integer Zeta Values

When expanding each sum into power series for large \(n\), we discover terms involving the Riemann zeta values \(\zeta(k)\):

- **S_even:** Expands into even-powered terms (\(\zeta(2), \zeta(4), \zeta(6), \dots\)).
- **S_odd:** Expands into odd-powered terms (\(\zeta(3), \zeta(5), \zeta(7), \dots\)).

Their difference neatly combines **all integer zeta values** \(\zeta(k)\) for \(k \geq 2\):

\[
S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} = \alpha_2 \zeta(2) + \alpha_3 \zeta(3) + \alpha_4 \zeta(4) + \alpha_5 \zeta(5) + \dots \approx 4.35623879,
\]

where coefficients \(\alpha_k\) are rational multiples of \(\pi^{2k+1}\). The initial terms are:

- \(\alpha_2 = +\frac{\pi^3}{3}\),
- \(\alpha_3 = -\frac{\pi^3}{3}\),
- \(\alpha_4 = -\frac{\pi^5}{60}\),
- \(\alpha_5 = +\frac{\pi^5}{60}\),
- and so forth, alternating in sign and pairing even–odd zeta values.

---

## 3. Leading Terms in Each Expansion

- **For \(\zeta(2)\):**  
  The perimeter shortfall begins with a term proportional to \(\frac{1}{n^2}\), summing naturally to \(\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\).

- **For \(\zeta(3)\):**  
  The chord–arc difference starts at \(\frac{1}{n^3}\), summing naturally to \(\zeta(3)\). The coefficient \(\frac{\pi^3}{3}\) emerges from the small-angle expansion of \(\sin x\).

A clear pairing pattern emerges:

\[
\left( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(2), \quad \left( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(3), \quad \left( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(4), \quad \left( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(5), \dots
\]

with alternating signs for consecutive values of \(\zeta(k)\).

---

## 4. Numerical Value and No Known Closed Form

- **Numerical Approximation:**  
  \(\Delta \approx 4.35623879\).

- **No Known Closed Form:**  
  \(\Delta\) cannot be expressed purely in terms of \(\pi\) or other elementary constants. It thus represents a new mathematical constant arising explicitly from an infinite sum of scaled zeta values.

---

## 5. Conceptual Interpretation

- **Circle–Polygon Geometry:**  
  \(S_\text{even}\) and \(S_\text{odd}\) illustrate two distinct geometric approaches to approximating a circle using polygons:
  - **Polygonal perimeter shortfall:** Summing differences for entire \(n\)-gon perimeters.
  - **Chord–arc differences:** Summing discrepancies on individual sides of polygons.

- **Even vs. Odd Zeta Shift:**  
  Multiplying \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\) by \(n\) shifts the dominant powers from odd (\(\frac{1}{n^3}\)) to even (\(\frac{1}{n^2}\)), systematically toggling between odd and even exponents.

- **Unified Zeta Series:**  
  The difference \(\Delta\) neatly encapsulates the infinite set of zeta values (\(\zeta(2), \zeta(3), \zeta(4), \dots\)) into a single geometric expression:

\[
S_\text{even} - S_\text{odd} \approx 4.35623879
\]

This elegant framework unifies all integer zeta values (\(k \geq 2\)) within a simple geometric comparison between circles and polygons.

## 6. Dimensionless Ratio and Complexity Measure

Finally, we introduce the dimensionless ratio:

\[
\frac{S_{\text{odd}}}{S_{\text{even}}} = \frac{8.19286978300348}{12.54910856747651} \approx 0.65286468.
\]

This ratio quantifies how the cumulative side-by-side chord–arc differences compare to the entire polygon perimeter discrepancies. Specifically, it captures:

- **Side‐by‐side perspective:** Chord–arc gaps summed individually over all polygons.
- **Whole‐polygon perspective:** Complete polygon perimeter shortfalls relative to the circle, also summed over all polygons.

With a numerical value around \(0.653\), it indicates that about **65%** of total "polygon-level complexity" is captured by summing individual chord–arc differences alone.
