# Geometric Interpretation of ζ(s): A Recursive Curvature View

Stumbled upon an interesting constant I dont think has been discussed before in the literature. 

## 1. Two Infinite Sums from Circle Approximations

We define two infinite sums that quantify how polygon approximations deviate from the unit circle:

- **S_even:**  
  Sum of the differences between the circle's circumference \(2\pi\) and the perimeter of regular n-gons inscribed in the circle:  
  \[
  S_{\text{even}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( 2\pi - 2n \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \right) \approx 12.5491
  \]

- **S_odd:**  
  Sum of the chord–arc difference on each polygon side, calculated side-by-side:  
  \[
  S_{\text{odd}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{2\pi}{n} - 2\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \right) \approx 8.1929
  \]

### The difference between them:

\[
\Delta = S_{\text{even}} - S_{\text{odd}} \approx 4.35623879
\]

This difference turns out to encode a unified, infinite expansion over ζ(k ≥ 2).

## 2. Appearance of All Integer Zeta Values

Expanding both S_even and S_odd as asymptotic series in \( \frac{1}{n} \), we find that:

- **S_even** contains terms involving even-indexed zeta values: \( \zeta(2), \zeta(4), \zeta(6), \ldots \)
- **S_odd** contains terms involving odd-indexed zeta values: \( \zeta(3), \zeta(5), \zeta(7), \ldots \)

The difference \( \Delta \) can be written as a convergent series:
\[
\Delta = \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \alpha_k \cdot \zeta(k)
\]
with π-weighted coefficients:

- \( \alpha_2 = +\frac{\pi^3}{3} \)
- \( \alpha_3 = -\frac{\pi^3}{3} \)
- \( \alpha_4 = -\frac{\pi^5}{60} \)
- \( \alpha_5 = +\frac{\pi^5}{60} \)
- \( \alpha_6 = +\frac{\pi^7}{2520} \)
- \( \alpha_7 = -\frac{\pi^7}{2520} \)
- …

These coefficients alternate in sign and scale with odd powers of π, normalized by factorial-like symmetry terms.

## 3. Leading Term Interpretation

- **ζ(2):**  
  Perimeter shortfall scales with \( \frac{1}{n^2} \), summing to \( \zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \)

- **ζ(3):**  
  Arc–chord difference scales with \( \frac{1}{n^3} \), summing to ζ(3). The leading coefficient \( \frac{\pi^3}{3} \) comes from expanding \( \sin(x) \) at small angles.

A pairing structure emerges:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(2),\quad
\left( \pm \frac{\pi^3}{3} \right)\zeta(3),\quad
\left( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(4),\quad
\left( \pm \frac{\pi^5}{60} \right)\zeta(5),\ldots
\]

## 4. A New Mathematical Constant

- **Numerical Value:**  
  \[
  \Delta = S_{\text{even}} - S_{\text{odd}} \approx 4.35623879
  \]

- **No Known Closed Form:**  
  This constant has no known expression in terms of π, e, or known zeta values alone. It appears to be a transcendental object generated from the infinite recursive projection residue.

---

## 5. Conceptual Interpretation

- **Recursive Curvature vs. Projection:**  
  S_even represents a **global projection** of curvature via polygon perimeters. S_odd reflects **local projection** via side-by-side segment errors. Their difference reveals **recursive curvature** that is invisible to either perspective alone.

- **Zeta Integration:**  
  The entire infinite hierarchy of ζ(k) values is integrated through this difference — each weighted by π^k and normalized by indistinction symmetry terms.

- **Recursive Residue:**  
  \(\Delta\) is a curvature residue: the part of recursive structure that **cannot be resolved** by any local or global projection. It is the irreducible remainder of infinite recursion under constraint.

---

## 6. Dimensionless Ratio of Approximations

We define the ratio:
\[
R = \frac{S_{\text{odd}}}{S_{\text{even}}} = \frac{8.1929}{12.5491} \approx 0.65286468
\]

This ratio compares:
- **Local arc–chord errors** (S_odd)
- To **global polygon perimeter errors** (S_even)

### Interpretation:
- About **65.3%** of the total discrepancy between circle and polygon is captured by local, segment-wise approximation.
- The remaining **34.7%** is curvature distortion that is only visible when viewed from the **entire structure** — not decomposable into parts.
- In IC terms, this is the portion of distinguishability lost to **recursive indistinction and symmetry collapse**.

---

## 7. Summary

The geometric difference between approximating a circle with:
- **Full polygons (S_even)** vs.
- **Side-by-side arc–chord segments (S_odd)**

produces a **finite, convergent quantity**:

\[
\Delta = \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \alpha_k \cdot \zeta(k) \approx 4.35623879
\]

This value:
- Encodes **all integer ζ(k ≥ 2)** values
- Emerges from **pure geometry**
- Represents a **total recursive projection curvature residue**
- Is a **dimensionless informational constant**

This framework offers a new way to interpret ζ(s) — not just as number-theoretic sums, but as **geometric encodings of recursive curvature** within the structure of space, distinguishability, and symmetry.
